# Build Feature Skill

Implements a single phase from a feature specification's task plan. The workflow iterates through build-test cycles until the phase satisfies its constitution gate, then records session memory, logs architectural decisions, and commits all changes.

## Prerequisites

* A feature spec directory exists at `specs/${input:spec-name}/` containing `plan.md`, `spec.md`, and `tasks.md`
* The target phase exists in `tasks.md` with defined tasks
* The project compiles before starting (`cargo check` passes)
* The `.github/agents/copilot-instructions.md` constitution and coding standards are accessible

## Quick Start

Invoke the skill with both required parameters:

```text
Build feature 001-<spec-name> phase <phase-number>
```

The skill runs autonomously through all required steps, halting only on unrecoverable errors or constitution violations requiring human judgment.

## Parameters Reference

| Parameter      | Required | Type    | Description                                                        |
| -------------- | -------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `spec-name`    | Yes      | string  | Directory name under `specs/` containing the feature specification |
| `phase-number` | Yes      | integer | Phase number from `tasks.md` to implement                          |

## Required Steps

### Step 1: Load Phase Context

* Read `specs/${input:spec-name}/tasks.md` and extract all tasks for the specified phase.
* Read `specs/${input:spec-name}/plan.md` for architecture, tech stack, and project structure.
* Read `specs/${input:spec-name}/spec.md` for user stories and acceptance scenarios relevant to this phase.
* Read `specs/${input:spec-name}/data-model.md` if it exists, for entity definitions and relationships.
* Read `specs/${input:spec-name}/contracts/` if it exists, for API specifications and error codes.
* Read `specs/${input:spec-name}/research.md` if it exists, for technical decisions and constraints.
* Read `.github/agents/copilot-instructions.md` for the project constitution, coding standards, and session memory requirements.
* Read `.github/agents/rust-engineer.agent.md` for language-specific engineering standards.
* Build a task execution list respecting dependencies: sequential tasks run in order, tasks marked `[P]` can run in parallel.
* Identify which tasks are tests and which are implementation; TDD order means test tasks execute before their corresponding implementation tasks.
* Report a summary of the phase scope: task count, estimated files affected, and user story coverage.

### Step 2: Check Constitution Gate

* Read `specs/${input:spec-name}/plan.md` and locate the Constitution Check table.
* Verify every principle listed in the table is satisfied for the work about to begin.
* If `specs/${input:spec-name}/checklists/` exists, scan all checklist files and verify completion status.
* If any constitution principle is violated or any required checklist is incomplete, halt and report the violation with actionable remediation steps.
* If all gates pass, proceed to Step 3.

### Step 3: Build Phase (Iterative)

Execute tasks in dependency order following TDD discipline:

1. For each task group (tests first, then implementation):
   * Read any existing source files that the task modifies.
   * Implement the task following the coding standards from the rust-engineer agent.
   * After implementing each task, run `cargo check` to verify compilation.
   * If compilation fails, diagnose the error, fix it, and re-run `cargo check` until it passes.
   * Mark the completed task as `[X]` in `specs/${input:spec-name}/tasks.md`.

2. Follow these implementation rules from the speckit.implement agent:
   * Setup tasks first (project structure, dependencies, configuration).
   * Test tasks before their corresponding implementation tasks (TDD).
   * Respect `[P]` markers: parallel tasks touching different files can be implemented together.
   * Sequential tasks (no `[P]` marker) must complete in listed order.
   * Tasks affecting the same files must run sequentially regardless of markers.

3. Track architectural decisions made during implementation for recording in Step 6.

### Step 4: Test Phase (Iterative)

Run the full test suite and iterate until all tests pass:

1. Run `cargo test` to execute all test suites.
2. If any test fails:
   * Diagnose the failure from the test output.
   * Fix the implementation (not the test, unless the test itself has a bug).
   * Re-run `cargo test` to verify the fix.
   * Repeat until all tests pass.
3. Run `cargo clippy -- -D warnings -D clippy::pedantic` to verify lint compliance.
4. If clippy reports warnings or errors, fix them and re-run until clean.
5. Run `cargo fmt --all -- --check` to verify formatting.
6. If formatting violations exist, run `cargo fmt --all` and verify.
7. Report final test results: suite counts, pass rates, and any notable findings.

Return to Step 3 if test failures reveal missing implementation work. Continue iterating between Step 3 and Step 4 until both build and test pass cleanly.

### Step 5: Constitution Validation

Re-check the constitution after implementation is complete:

* Verify `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` is maintained; no `unsafe` blocks introduced.
* Verify no `unwrap()` or `expect()` calls exist in library code paths.
* Verify all new public items have `///` doc comments.
* Verify error handling uses `TMemError` with proper error codes.
* Verify any new async code follows tokio patterns (no mutex guards held across await points).
* Verify test coverage aligns with the 80% target from the constitution.
* If any violation is found, return to Step 3 to remediate before proceeding.

### Step 6: Record Architectural Decisions

For each significant decision made during the build phase:

* Create an ADR file in `docs/adrs/` following the naming convention `NNNN-{short-title}.md` where `NNNN` is the next sequential number (zero-padded to 4 digits).
* Each ADR includes:
  * Title describing the decision
  * Status (Accepted)
  * Context explaining the problem or situation
  * Decision made and rationale
  * Consequences (positive, negative, and risks)
  * Date and the phase/task that prompted the decision
* Decisions worth recording include: dependency choices, API design trade-offs, data model changes, SurrealDB workarounds, error handling strategies, and performance trade-offs.
* Skip this step if no significant architectural decisions were made during the phase.

### Step 7: Record Session Memory

Persist the full session details to `.copilot-tracking/memory/` following the project's session memory requirements:

* Create a memory file at `.copilot-tracking/memory/{YYYY-MM-DD}/{spec-name}-phase-{N}-memory.md` where the date is today and N is the phase number.
* The memory file includes:
  * Task Overview: phase scope and objectives
  * Current State: all tasks completed, files modified, test results
  * Important Discoveries: decisions made, failed approaches, SurrealDB or framework quirks encountered
  * Next Steps: what the next phase should address, any open questions, known issues
  * Context to Preserve: source file references, agent references, unresolved questions
* Use the existing memory files in `.copilot-tracking/memory/` as format examples.

### Step 8: Stage and Commit

1. Review all changes made during the phase to ensure they align with the completed tasks and constitution.
2. Review the ADRs created in Step 6 for clarity and completeness.
3. Review all steps to ensure that no steps have been missed and address any missing steps in the sequence before proceeding.
4. Review the session memory file for completeness and accuracy.

### Step 9: Stage, Commit, and Sync

Finalize all changes with a Git commit:

1. Accept all current diff changes (no interactive review).
2. Run `git add -A` to stage all modified, created, and deleted files.
3. Compose a commit message following these conventions:
   * Format: `feat({spec-name}): complete phase {N} - {phase title}`
   * Body: list of completed task IDs and a brief summary of what was built
   * Footer: reference the spec path and any relevant ADR numbers
4. Run `git commit` with the composed message.
5. Report the commit hash and a summary of changes committed.

## Troubleshooting

### Build fails on fastembed/ort-sys

The `fastembed` crate is gated behind the `embeddings` feature flag. Default builds exclude it. If Phase 6 (semantic search) requires it, configure the TLS feature flag first.

### Tests pass locally but fail in CI

Verify `rust-toolchain.toml` matches the CI configuration in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. Check that the `[[test]]` entries in `Cargo.toml` include all external test files.

### Constitution violation detected

Return to Step 3 and fix the violation before proceeding. Common violations include `unwrap()` usage in library code, missing doc comments on public items, and `unsafe` blocks.
