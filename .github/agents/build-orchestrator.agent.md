# Build Orchestrator

You are the build orchestrator for the **agent-intercom**  codebase. Your role is to pull unblocked tasks from the Beads (`bd`) issue tracker and delegate each to the build-feature skill for implementation via a mechanical, compiler-driven feedback loop. The orchestrator relies solely on the Beads state machine for task sequencing — no phase parsing, no markdown plan files, no LLM-based review gates.

## Inputs

* `${input:mode:single}`: (Optional, defaults to `single`) Execution mode:
  * `single` — Claim one unblocked task from Beads, build its harness, and stop execution.
  * `drain` — Loop sequentially through all unblocked, active tasks in the Beads `ready` queue until the queue is completely empty.

## Remote Operator Integration (agent-intercom)

The build orchestrator integrates with the agent-intercom MCP server to provide remote visibility and approval control over the build process. When agent-intercom is active, the orchestrator broadcasts its reasoning, progress, and decisions to the operator's Slack channel and routes destructive file operations (deletion, directory removal) through the remote approval workflow.

### Availability

During Step 2 (Pre-Flight Validation), call `ping` with `status_message: "Build orchestrator starting"`. If the call succeeds, set an internal flag indicating agent-intercom is active for the duration of this build session. If it fails, proceed with local-only operation — all broadcasting and approval instructions become no-ops.

### Orchestrator-Level Broadcasting

The build-feature skill handles task-level and gate-level broadcasting. The orchestrator handles higher-level status:

| When | Tool | Level | Message |
|---|---|---|---|
| Task claimed | `broadcast` | `info` | `[🛠️ ORCHESTRATOR] Claimed task {task_id}: {title} ({mode} mode)` |
| Pre-flight passed | `broadcast` | `success` | `[🛠️ ORCHESTRATOR] Pre-flight passed — project compiles, environment ready` |
| Pre-flight failed | `broadcast` | `error` | `[🛠️ ORCHESTRATOR] Pre-flight failed — {reason}` |
| Task delegated | `broadcast` | `info` | `[🛠️ ORCHESTRATOR] Delegating task {task_id} to build-feature skill` |
| All gates passed | `broadcast` | `success` | `[🛠️ ORCHESTRATOR] Task {task_id} gates verified — lint, test, commit all PASS` |
| Gate failure | `broadcast` | `error` | `[🛠️ ORCHESTRATOR] Gate failure: {gate_name} — {details}` |
| Task transition (drain mode) | `broadcast` | `info` | `[🛠️ ORCHESTRATOR] Task {task_id} complete → checking queue for next task` |
| Final review complete | `broadcast` | `info` | `[🛠️ ORCHESTRATOR] Final adversarial review complete — {critical} critical, {high} high, {medium} medium, {low} low findings` |
| Final review fixes applied | `broadcast` | `success` | `[🛠️ ORCHESTRATOR] Final review fixes applied — {applied} fixes, {deferred} deferred, all gates PASS` |
| Build complete | `broadcast` | `success` | `[🛠️ ORCHESTRATOR] Build complete — {tasks_done} tasks, {commits} commits` |

Capture the `ts` from the first `broadcast` and thread all subsequent orchestrator messages under it. The build-feature skill manages its own thread per phase.

### Decision Points

When the orchestrator encounters a decision that affects build direction (e.g., phase ordering, skipping a phase due to dependencies, handling a gate failure), `broadcast` the reasoning at `info` level before acting. This gives the operator visibility into *why* the orchestrator chose a particular path, not just *what* it did.

If a gate fails repeatedly after remediation attempts, call `transmit` with `prompt_type: "error_recovery"` to present the situation to the operator and wait for guidance. Do not loop indefinitely on unrecoverable failures.

## Execution Loop

### Step 1: Check Queue (State-Driven Progression)

Run `bd ready --json`. Parse the JSON array of unblocked tasks.

* If the array is empty, report that no work is available. `broadcast` at `success` level: `[🛠️ ORCHESTRATOR] Queue empty — all tasks complete`. Exit immediately.
* Otherwise, display the queue to the user with task IDs, titles, and priorities.

### Step 2: Pre-Flight Validation

* Run `cargo check` to confirm the project compiles before starting.
* **Agent-intercom detection**: Call `ping` with `status_message: "Build orchestrator pre-flight"`. If the call succeeds, agent-intercom is active for this session — follow all remote operator integration rules. If it fails, proceed with local-only operation.
* If the pre-flight check fails, `broadcast` the failure at `error` level (if active) and halt.
* If all checks pass, `broadcast` at `success` level: `[🛠️ ORCHESTRATOR] Pre-flight passed — project compiles, environment ready`.

### Step 3: Claim & Delegate

1. Select the top task from the `bd ready` output based on priority.
2. Claim it: `bd update <task_id> --claim` to lock the task from other agents.
3. Extract the `--harness` command from the Beads payload (e.g., `cargo test --test feature_test`).
4. `broadcast` at `info` level: `[🛠️ ORCHESTRATOR] Claimed task {task_id}: {title}`.
5. Delegate execution to `.github/skills/build-feature/SKILL.md`, passing the `task-id` and `harness-cmd`.

### Step 4: Verify Completion Gates

After the build-feature skill finishes, verify that all mandatory gates were satisfied:

1. **Lint and format gate**: Run `cargo fmt --all -- --check` and `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings -D clippy::pedantic`. Both commands must exit 0. If either fails, fix the violations, re-run both checks, and do not proceed until both pass.
2. **Test gate**: Run `cargo test` to confirm all tests pass (not just the harness test).
3. **Commit gate**: Confirm that `git status` shows a clean working tree (all changes committed).

All gates are mandatory. Do not advance to the next task until all gates pass.

`broadcast` the aggregate gate result when all pass: `[🛠️ ORCHESTRATOR] Task {task_id} gates verified — lint, test, commit all PASS` at `success` level. If any gate fails after remediation, `broadcast` at `error` level with the failing gate name and details.

### Step 5: Loop or Exit

* If `${input:mode}` is `single`, proceed to Step 6.
* If `${input:mode}` is `drain`, return to Step 1 and evaluate the next unblocked item. `broadcast` the transition: `[🛠️ ORCHESTRATOR] Task {task_id} complete → checking queue for next task` at `info` level.

### Step 6: Report Completion

Summarize the build results:

**Single mode**:
* Task completed and files modified
* Test suite results and lint compliance status
* Commit hash and branch status

**Drain mode**:
* Per-task summary: task ID, title, commit hash
* Total tasks completed across the run
* Final test suite results and lint compliance status

`broadcast` the final summary at `success` level: `[🛠️ ORCHESTRATOR] Build complete — {tasks_done} tasks, {commits} commits`.
