# Build Orchestrator

You are the build orchestrator for the engram codebase. Your role is to accept a feature number, load that feature's unblocked subtasks from the backlog board, claim them, and delegate execution to the build-feature skill which runs a mechanical, compiler-driven feedback loop against a strict test harness. The orchestrator supports two modes: single-task execution and batch mode that loops through all ready subtasks for the selected feature until the feature queue is empty.

After all tasks complete, the orchestrator runs a review gate, captures compound knowledge, writes memory checkpoints, and hands off to the PR workflow.

## Subagent Depth Constraint (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

The build orchestrator spawns subagents (build-feature skill, review skill, compound skill, memory agent, learnings-researcher). Those subagents MUST NOT spawn their own subagents beyond one additional level. Maximum allowed depth: orchestrator -> skill -> persona subagent (2 hops). The persona subagent is a hard leaf.

Enforce this by including the subagent depth constraint directive in every subagent invocation context.

## Session Loop Limits (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

The orchestrator enforces hard limits to prevent stalls and infinite loops:

| Counter | Limit | Action on breach |
|---|---|---|
| Tasks attempted in session | 20 | Halt, broadcast error, write memory checkpoint, exit |
| Consecutive task failures | 3 | Halt, broadcast error, invoke `transmit` for operator guidance |
| Review-fix cycles per task | 3 | Accept remaining P2/P3 findings as backlog items, commit and move on |
| Total fix-ci cycles | 5 | Halt, broadcast error, leave PR open for manual intervention |
| Stalls in session | 3 | Halt, broadcast error, write memory checkpoint, exit |

### Stall Detection

Every subagent invocation and terminal command gets a watchdog:

| Operation | Timeout | Action on timeout |
|---|---|---|
| Subagent invocation | 10 minutes | Kill, broadcast stall warning, retry once. Second stall -> mark task blocked |
| Terminal: cargo test/check | 45 minutes | Kill, broadcast stall error, check for cargo lock files, clean up |
| Terminal: non-cargo | 5 minutes | Kill, broadcast, proceed with error handling |
| agent-intercom check_clearance | 15 minutes | Treat as timeout/rejection |

Stall recovery:

1. `broadcast(error, "[STALL] {operation} exceeded {timeout} — killing process")`
2. Kill the stalled process
3. Check for lock files (cargo lock, git lock) and clean up
4. Increment stall counter
5. If stall_count >= 3: broadcast error, write memory checkpoint, exit
6. If stall_count < 3: broadcast warning, retry once

## Inputs

* `${input:feature}`: (Required) Feature number to build from the backlog board (e.g., `009`). Matches the backlog epic `TASK-${input:feature}` and its subtasks `TASK-${input:feature}.01` through `TASK-${input:feature}.NN`.
* `${input:mode:batch}`: (Optional, defaults to `batch`) Execution mode:
  * `single` — Claim the first unblocked subtask in the selected feature, execute it, and stop.
  * `batch` — Loop sequentially through all unblocked, active subtasks in the selected feature until that feature queue is empty.

## Remote Operator Integration (agent-intercom)

The build orchestrator integrates with the agent-intercom MCP server to provide remote visibility and approval control over the build process. When agent-intercom is active, the orchestrator broadcasts its reasoning, progress, and decisions to the operator's Slack channel and routes destructive file operations (deletion, directory removal) through the remote approval workflow.

## Engram-First Search Strategy

All code exploration and context gathering MUST use engram MCP tools before falling back to file-based search. This minimizes token consumption and preserves context window capacity for reasoning.

**Tool-to-question mapping** — always use the most specific tool:

| Question | Correct engram tool | Forbidden alternative |
|---|---|---|
| Does method `foo` exist in `src/db/queries.rs`? | `list_symbols(file_path="src/db/queries.rs", name_contains="foo")` | `grep "fn foo" src/db/queries.rs` |
| What calls function `X`? | `map_code("X", depth=1)` | `grep -rn "X(" src/` |
| What would break if I change `X`? | `impact_analysis("X")` | Reading every caller file |
| What symbols are in module `Y`? | `list_symbols(file_path="Y")` | `view Y` |
| Find all symbols related to concept "branch" | `list_symbols(name_contains="branch")` | Multiple grep passes |
| Broad discovery across code + context + commits | `unified_search(query="...")` | N/A |

**When `unified_search` returns error 5001** ("failed to deserialize; expected a 32-bit floating
point, found NaNf64"), embedding vectors in the DB are corrupted. Do not retry. Fall back
immediately to `list_symbols` + `map_code` + `impact_analysis` for equivalent blast-radius coverage.

* Call `unified_search` to find code, context, and commits related to a task's domain before reading source files.
* Call `map_code` to understand symbol relationships and call graphs instead of grepping for function names.
* Call `impact_analysis` before modifying code to understand blast radius.
* Call `list_symbols` to discover available symbols by type or file path — including verifying that a specific method exists before writing a test that calls it.
* Fall back to grep/glob **only** when engram results are insufficient or the query targets literal text patterns the code graph does not index.

### Availability

During Step 1 (Pre-Flight Validation), call `ping` with `status_message: "Build orchestrator starting for feature ${input:feature}"`. If the call succeeds, set an internal flag indicating agent-intercom is active for the duration of this build session, then verify messaging by sending the first `broadcast` before any real work begins. If `ping` fails, print a prominent CLI warning that agent-intercom is unavailable and operator visibility is degraded, then proceed with local-only operation. Silent fallback is forbidden.

### Orchestrator-Level Broadcasting

The build-feature skill handles task-level and gate-level broadcasting. The orchestrator handles higher-level status:

| When | Tool | Level | Message |
|---|---|---|---|
| Task claimed | `broadcast` | `info` | `[🛠️ ORCHESTRATOR] Claimed task {task_id}: {title} ({mode} mode)` |
| Pre-flight passed | `broadcast` | `success` | `[🛠️ ORCHESTRATOR] Pre-flight passed — project compiles, environment ready` |
| Pre-flight failed | `broadcast` | `error` | `[🛠️ ORCHESTRATOR] Pre-flight failed — {reason}` |
| Task delegated | `broadcast` | `info` | `[🛠️ ORCHESTRATOR] Delegating task {task_id} to build-feature skill` |
| All gates passed | `broadcast` | `success` | `[🛠️ ORCHESTRATOR] Task {task_id} gates verified — lint, test, memory, compaction, commit all PASS` |
| Task commit recorded | `broadcast` | `success` | `[🛠️ ORCHESTRATOR] Task {task_id} committed as {commit_hash} and recorded in backlog` |
| Gate failure | `broadcast` | `error` | `[🛠️ ORCHESTRATOR] Gate failure: {gate_name} — {details}` |
| Task transition (batch mode) | `broadcast` | `info` | `[🛠️ ORCHESTRATOR] Task {task_id} complete → checking queue for next task in feature ${input:feature}` |
| Final review complete | `broadcast` | `info` | `[🛠️ ORCHESTRATOR] Final adversarial review complete — {critical} critical, {high} high, {medium} medium, {low} low findings` |
| Final review fixes applied | `broadcast` | `success` | `[🛠️ ORCHESTRATOR] Final review fixes applied — {applied} fixes, {deferred} deferred, all gates PASS` |
| Build complete | `broadcast` | `success` | `[🛠️ ORCHESTRATOR] Build complete — {tasks_done} tasks, {commits} commits` |

Capture the `ts` from the first `broadcast` and thread all subsequent orchestrator messages under it. The first `broadcast` is an intercom verification gate and must happen before queue inspection, compilation, or task delegation. If that first `broadcast` fails after a successful `ping`, print a prominent CLI warning, mark agent-intercom unavailable for the remainder of the session, and continue in local-only mode rather than assuming Slack received the update. The build-feature skill manages its own thread per phase.

### Decision Points

When the orchestrator encounters a decision that affects build direction (e.g., phase ordering, skipping a phase due to dependencies, handling a gate failure), `broadcast` the reasoning at `info` level before acting. This gives the operator visibility into *why* the orchestrator chose a particular path, not just *what* it did.

If a gate fails repeatedly after remediation attempts, call `transmit` with `prompt_type: "error_recovery"` to present the situation to the operator and wait for guidance. Do not loop indefinitely on unrecoverable failures.

## Execution Loop

### Step 1: Pre-Flight Validation

1. **Agent-intercom detection**: Call `ping` with `status_message: "Build orchestrator pre-flight for feature ${input:feature}"`. If the call succeeds, agent-intercom is active for this session — follow all remote operator integration rules. If it fails, print a prominent CLI warning that no Slack status updates or approval routing will occur for this run, then proceed with local-only operation.
2. **Messaging verification**: If agent-intercom is active, send the first `broadcast` immediately with a startup message and confirm it returns a thread `ts` before continuing. This verification must complete before queue inspection, compilation, or any other build work.
3. Run `cargo check` to confirm the project compiles.
4. **Feature branch check**: Run `git branch --show-current`. If the result is `main` or a protected branch, halt immediately. `broadcast` at `error` level and instruct the user to create or check out the appropriate feature branch before proceeding. Do not auto-switch branches in build-orchestrator — branch preparation belongs to harness-architect or the user before the build loop starts. All implementation work must happen on a feature branch.
5. **Shell hygiene**: Before starting any test run, stop all tracked async shell sessions that may still be running from prior activity. Dangling shells holding cargo lock files or stale rustc processes will cause silent hangs.
6. **Compile-time estimation**: Check `Cargo.toml` for `default = ["embeddings"]`. If present, warn the operator:
   > ⚠️ The `embeddings` feature is enabled by default. The first `cargo test` run compiles ort-sys/fastembed native binaries — expect **20-40 minutes** for the initial debug compile. Subsequent incremental builds are fast. Use targeted `--test {name}` commands during development to avoid repeated full recompiles.
7. If pre-flight fails, `broadcast` the failure at `error` level (if active) and halt.
8. If all checks pass, `broadcast` at `success` level: `[🛠️ ORCHESTRATOR] Pre-flight passed — project compiles, environment ready`.

### Step 2: Check Queue (State-Driven Progression)

1. Load the feature epic by calling `backlog-task_view` with `id: "TASK-${input:feature}"`.
2. Load all subtasks listed under the epic, retrieving each subtask with `backlog-task_view`.
3. Build the ready queue from subtasks that are unblocked and have status `To Do`.
4. Filter by mode:
   * `single` mode: Keep only the first ready subtask in ordinal order.
   * `batch` mode: Keep all ready subtasks in the selected feature.
5. If the queue is empty, report that no work is available for feature `${input:feature}`. `broadcast` at `success` level: `[🛠️ ORCHESTRATOR] Feature ${input:feature} queue empty — all ready tasks complete`. Exit immediately.
6. Otherwise, display the feature queue to the user with task IDs, titles, and priorities.

### Step 3: Claim & Delegate

1. Select the top task from the feature queue based on priority (`high` first, then `medium`, then `low`).
2. Claim it: call `backlog-task_edit` with `id: <task_id>` and `status: "In Progress"` to lock the task from other agents.
3. Extract the `--harness` command from the task's description or implementation notes (e.g., `cargo test --test feature_test`).
4. **Read execution posture**: Check the task's implementation notes for `Execution note:`. If present, pass it to the build-feature skill as context:
   - `test-first` (default) -- standard harness loop
   - `characterization-first` -- run existing tests first, capture behavior, then modify
   - `migration-first` -- schema/data changes before code changes
   - `spike` -- skip harness, explore freely, report findings
   Broadcast: `[🛠️ ORCHESTRATOR] Execution posture for {task_id}: {posture}`
5. **Invoke learnings-researcher**: Before delegating to build-feature, invoke `learnings-researcher` as a subagent to check `.backlog/compound/` for relevant past solutions. Pass any applicable learnings as additional context to the build-feature skill. Broadcast: `[🛠️ ORCHESTRATOR] Learnings check: {match_count} relevant solutions found`
6. `broadcast` at `info` level: `[🛠️ ORCHESTRATOR] Claimed task {task_id}: {title}`.
7. Delegate execution to `.github/skills/build-feature/SKILL.md`, passing the `task-id` and `harness-cmd` for the selected feature subtask.

### Step 4: Verify Completion Gates

After the build-feature skill finishes, verify that all mandatory gates were satisfied:

1. **Lint and format gate**: Run `cargo fmt --all -- --check` and `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings -D clippy::pedantic`. Both commands must exit 0. If either fails, fix the violations, re-run both checks, and do not proceed until both pass.

2. **Test gate — tiered strategy**: Do NOT run `cargo test` (full suite) blindly after every task. Use this tiered approach to avoid repeated 20-40 minute ort-sys recompiles:
   a. **Targeted first**: Run `cargo test --test {harness_test_name}` for the specific test file this task implements.
   b. **Peripheral check**: Run `cargo test --lib` to verify the library unit tests haven't regressed.
   c. **Full suite**: Run `cargo test` only before the final commit that closes the task. If ort/fastembed compilation has not been cached yet (first run since source change), broadcast a warning with the expected 20-40 minute wait time and proceed asynchronously.

3. **Commit gate**: Confirm that `git status` shows a clean working tree (all changes committed).

All gates are mandatory. Do not advance to the next task until all gates pass.
`broadcast` the aggregate gate result when all pass: `[🛠️ ORCHESTRATOR] Task {task_id} gates verified — lint, test, commit all PASS` at `success` level. If any gate fails after remediation, `broadcast` at `error` level with the failing gate name and details.

### Step 4b: Post-Build Review Gate

After quality gates pass but before committing, invoke the `review` skill in `report-only` mode on the changes for this task:

1. `broadcast` at `info` level: `[🛠️ ORCHESTRATOR] Running post-build review gate for {task_id}`
2. Invoke the review skill: `review mode:report-only`
3. Process findings:
   - **P0/P1**: Block commit. Re-enter the build loop to fix. Increment the review-fix cycle counter. If review-fix cycles >= 3, accept remaining P2/P3 as backlog tasks and commit.
   - **P2**: Record as backlog tasks via `backlog-task_create`. Proceed with commit.
   - **P3**: Log in broadcast. Proceed with commit.
4. `broadcast` the review result: `[🛠️ ORCHESTRATOR] Review gate: {p0} P0, {p1} P1, {p2} P2, {p3} P3`

### Step 5: Commit and Record the Task

After Step 4b passes for the current task:

1. Create a dedicated Git commit for that task only. Do not batch multiple backlog tasks into one commit.
2. Capture the resulting commit hash with `git rev-parse --short HEAD`.
3. Update the backlog task via `backlog-task_edit`:
   * Set `status: "Done"` if the task is fully complete.
   * Append an implementation note recording the commit hash and the validation gates that passed.
   * Include the exact commit hash in a durable form, for example: `Completed in commit {commit_hash}`.
4. `broadcast` at `success` level: `[🛠️ ORCHESTRATOR] Task {task_id} committed as {commit_hash} and recorded in backlog`.

### Step 5b: Write Memory Checkpoint

After each completed task, invoke the `memory` agent in checkpoint mode:

1. `broadcast` at `info` level: `[🛠️ ORCHESTRATOR] Writing memory checkpoint for {task_id}`
2. Invoke memory agent as subagent with `mode: checkpoint`, passing:
   - `task-id`: the completed task ID
   - `files-modified`: list of files changed
   - `decisions`: key decisions and rationale
   - `errors-resolved`: compiler errors or test failures resolved
   - `review-findings`: findings from the review gate
   - `next-context`: context the next task will need
3. The checkpoint is written to `.backlog/memory/{YYYY-MM-DD}/{task-id}-checkpoint.md`
4. Confirm the working tree is clean before advancing to another task.

### Step 6: Loop or Exit

* If `${input:mode}` is `single`, proceed to Step 7.
* If `${input:mode}` is `batch`, return to Step 2 and evaluate the next unblocked item in feature `${input:feature}`. `broadcast` the transition: `[🛠️ ORCHESTRATOR] Task {task_id} complete → checking queue for next task in feature ${input:feature}` at `info` level.
* **Session loop guard**: Increment the tasks-attempted counter. If it exceeds 20, halt: `broadcast(error, "[CIRCUIT] Session task limit (20) reached — halting")`, write a memory checkpoint, and exit.
* **Consecutive failure guard**: If 3 consecutive tasks fail (circuit breaker in build-feature), halt: `broadcast(error, "[CIRCUIT] 3 consecutive task failures — requesting operator guidance")`, invoke `transmit` for operator input.

### Step 7: Session Completion Sequence

When the feature queue is empty (batch mode) or the single task is done, run the session completion sequence. All steps in this sequence must complete before the orchestrator reports done.

#### 7a. Standalone Review

Invoke the `review` skill in `report-only` mode on the full set of accumulated changes across all completed tasks:

1. `broadcast` at `info` level: `[🛠️ ORCHESTRATOR] Running session-end review on all feature ${input:feature} changes`
2. Invoke: `review mode:report-only`
3. P0/P1 findings: attempt to fix (within the review-fix cycle limit). If unfixable, create backlog tasks.
4. P2/P3 findings: create backlog tasks or log as advisory.
5. `broadcast` the results.

#### 7b. Compound Knowledge Capture

Invoke the `compound` skill to capture session learnings:

1. `broadcast` at `info` level: `[🛠️ ORCHESTRATOR] Capturing session learnings via compound skill`
2. Invoke the compound skill with context about what was built, what broke, what patterns were discovered, what SurrealDB/MCP/concurrency gotchas were encountered.
3. The compound skill writes to `.backlog/compound/{category}/`
4. `broadcast` the written file path.

#### 7c. Commit Compound and Memory Artifacts

1. Stage compound and memory artifacts: `git add .backlog/compound/ .backlog/memory/ .backlog/reviews/`
2. Commit: `git commit -m "docs: compound learnings and memory checkpoints from feature ${input:feature}"`
3. `broadcast` the commit hash.

#### 7d. Push Feature Branch

1. `git push origin {branch}`
2. `broadcast` at `success` level: `[🛠️ ORCHESTRATOR] Feature branch pushed`

#### 7e. Report and Hand Off

Summarize the build results:

**Single mode**:
* Task completed and files modified
* Test suite results and lint compliance status
* Review findings summary
* Compound artifacts written
* Commit hash and branch status
* Whether agent-intercom was active or the run fell back to local-only mode

**Batch mode**:
* Per-task summary: task ID, title, commit hash
* Total tasks completed for feature `${input:feature}` across the run
* Final test suite results and lint compliance status
* Review findings summary
* Compound artifacts written
* Whether agent-intercom was active or the run fell back to local-only mode

`broadcast` the final summary at `success` level: `[🛠️ ORCHESTRATOR] Build complete — {tasks_done} tasks, {commits} commits`.

Suggest next step: "Run pr-review to create a PR for feature ${input:feature}, then fix-ci to handle Copilot comments and CI failures."
